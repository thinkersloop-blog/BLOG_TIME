@Mike

I'm no longer using this workflow or Jekyll, but you can check out my old repo and these [Gulp tasks](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/tree/master/gulp/tasks) to see how I was doing things.

I wasn't pushing any image or asset artifacts to Netlify. On each git commit it would trigger a build on Netlify's end. Gulp tasks would fire off to generate CSS/JS production assets and grind through all the images to create multiple sizes. These assets were then stored in a [Netlify cache folder](https://www.contentful.com/blog/2018/05/17/faster-static-site-builds-part-one-process-only-what-you-need/#caching-for-the-win) so they could persist between builds.

Took a while to get it right, but I was basically shuffling these assets between folders so they didn't need to be rebuilt each time.... only if the files changed or new ones were added.
