@Michael

Many thanks for your answers. I've managed my site workflow and stucking with different problems time-to-time. Your posts, forum messages, and sourcecode helps me a lot, but I'm pretty far from JS so Gulp and mostly architecture of workflow is painful for me.)

Could you explain how you working with already generated assets? Git push is triggering Netlify build, but you generated responsive images locally in advance. How are you deploying this dir to your site assuming Netlify is responsive for a build? Is Netlify get generated assets as an external artifact?

My life was OK before I started to mess with responsive images.)
